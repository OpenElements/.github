### Helping Open Source

Open collaboration is a central concept of the work at Open Elements. To do so we contribute to OSS in several different ways:
- We contributed to several open source projects like [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java), [JSF](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces), [Eclipse Adoptium](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium), [Apache Tuweni](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni), [Hedera Hashgraph](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services), [IcedTea-Web](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/IcedTea-Web), and others
- We helped to form the open [Java Bean Validation](https://beanvalidation.org) standard as part of the [JSR 380 export group](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380) and Jakarta Bean Validation contributor ([LINK](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.bean-validation))
- We sponsor several Open Source projects and organizations at GitHub with financially support ([LINK](https://github.com/orgs/OpenElements/sponsoring))
- We are part of the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org) as a contributing member ([LINK](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=1600))
- We are a offical supporter of the [OSPO Alliance](https://ospo.zone) since its start ([LINK](http://ospo.zone/membership/))

- As a participant member we are part of the [JakartaEE](https://jakarta.ee) working group ([LINK](https://jakarta.ee/membership/members/))

### Helping Newcomers

At Open Elements we want to help people to get into Open Source. Therefore it is quite important for us to provide help to people that want to start working on OSS. We did [several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74AiufFGVug) [sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0UPHHsgOHg) about Open Source at conferences and meetups in the past and helped projects like [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK) or [Eclipse Adoptium](https://github.com/adoptium) to create issues for newcomers. In future we will provide good first issues for newcomers and even more help to get into open source by promoting events like [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com).
