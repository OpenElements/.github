### About Open Elements

Open Elements is an IT company whose main focus is on the two points of Open Source Software (OSS) and Java. By focusing on these two points, we can provide our customers with expert advice and support in the development and use of Open Source Software. By specializing in Java-based OSS, we are members of the leading committees and foundations on these topics and actively contribute to the further development of critical open source systems in the Java ecosystem.

### Helping Open Source

Open collaboration is a central concept of the work at [Open Elements](https://open-elements.com). To do so we contribute to OSS in several different ways:
- We contribute to several open source projects like [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java), [JSF](https://github.com/jakartaee/faces), [Eclipse Adoptium](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium), [Apache Tuweni](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tuweni), [Hedera Hashgraph](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services), [IcedTea-Web](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/IcedTea-Web), and others
- We helped to form the open [Java Bean Validation](https://beanvalidation.org) standard as part of the [JSR 380 export group](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=380) and Jakarta Bean Validation contributor ([LINK](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.bean-validation))
- We sponsor several Open Source projects and organizations at GitHub with financially support ([LINK](https://github.com/orgs/OpenElements/sponsoring))
- We are part of the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org) as a contributing member ([LINK](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/showMember.php?member_id=1600))
- We are a offical supporter of the [OSPO Alliance](https://ospo.zone) since its start ([LINK](http://ospo.zone/membership/))
- We are a member of the [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) working group ([LINK](https://adoptium.net/de/members/))

### Helping Newcomers

At [Open Elements](https://open-elements.com) we want to help people to get into Open Source. Therefore it is quite important for us to provide help to people that want to start working on OSS. We did [several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74AiufFGVug) [sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0UPHHsgOHg) about Open Source at conferences and meetups in the past and helped projects like [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK) or [Eclipse Adoptium](https://github.com/adoptium) to create issues for newcomers. In future we will provide good first issues for our projects and offer additional help to get into open source by promoting events like [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com).
