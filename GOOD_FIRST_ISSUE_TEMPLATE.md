A more detailed general documentation of the GitHub PR workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md).

- [ ] **Claim this issue:** Comment below that you are interested in working on the issue

- [ ] **Fork the repository:** You can do that in GitHub (by simply clicking the 'fork' button).
